		<h1>Explain the concepts</h1>
		<h2>
			The major concept used in this question were arrow function and try and catch. <br/>
			Arrow functions are substitute to normal function to make it advance.
			Try executes all the statements which are true and as soon as it encounter any error <br/>
			it goes to catch block to deal with error.

		<h2>Here , on calling the function , the function is first going to try block which <br/>
			will create a error with "throw new Error" , it will force the code to go to catch block.
			 <br/> Catch take argument a , inside catch two variables a and b are created and given <br/>
			 values equals to 1. and then it printed a wiz. "a=1". Then, after catch we printed a and b <br/>
			  which resulted in "a=undefined" and "b=1" because b was parameter of catch and was only defined <br/>
			  inside catch only.
