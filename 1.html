            On the execution of the following code the output will be "76" <br/>
            Initially the value being executed and on resolve it is giving value of v or input as 37 <br/>
            as it is being resolve it will go to then block , in first then block the value <br/>
            of v will be multiplied by 2 , in second then block the value of v will be divided by 2 so will return <br/>
            back to "37" in third then block in will again be multiplied by 2 and then subtracted by 2 <br/>
            and then added by 2 which will make it as "74" and then in the next then block it will be add 2 more <br/>
            to make it 76. Hence , it is what the output is. As the problem had no error or it was just executed on <br/>
            being resolve. it traveled and returned it's value and in last .then block it printed it's value.
